 \section*{Abstract}
 
 \section*{Introduction}
     Provide the problem statement
  \subsection*{Background}
     A more detailed introduction with background and literature review.  Interesting citations: Kiva, Slab/Basement, HVAC\&R paper, etc.
  \subsection*{Scope and Purpose}
     What are the actual goals of this paper?
  \subsection*{Mathematical reasoning for the approach used here...how does taking a temperature slice in the domain help?}
 
 \section*{Preliminary Model Evaluation} 
  Describe the model, focus on three phases: initial implementation (cite the old paper), experimental and other validation to build confidence, and then changes since then.  Description of BESTEST results here.
 
 \section*{Experiment A: Characterizing Heat Flows}
  \section*{Ground/Building configuration and description}
   What are we modeling?
  \section*{Boundary conditions and ground properties}
   Yep. 
  \section*{Specific slices}
   Describle the slices we'll be taking through the domain
